# Online Trial Generation (OTG)
The purpose of this MATLAB-based toolbox is to create and present economic choice trials. It has two main applications:
1. Selecting the features (costs, rewards) of binary economic choices by applying an adaptive trial generation algorithm.
2. Presenting these trials to the participant (using the Psychtoolbox) in a characteristic binary choice screen where the costs (delay / risk / physical effort / mental effort) are symbolically represented.
The [wiki](https://github.com/MBB-team/OTG/wiki) associated with this toolbox describes all of its functionalities in detail.
