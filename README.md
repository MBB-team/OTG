# OTG
The purpose of this toolbox is to create and present economic choice trials. As such, it has two purposes:
1. Select the features (costs, rewards) of binary economic choices by applying the Online Trial Generation (OTG) algorithm
2. Present these trials to the participant in a characteristic binary choice screen where the costs (delay / risk / physical effort / mental effort) are symbolically represented
The [wiki](https://github.com/MBB-team/OTG/wiki) associated with this toolbox describes all of its functionalities in detail.
